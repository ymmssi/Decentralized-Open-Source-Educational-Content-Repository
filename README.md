# 📚 Decentralized Open-Source Educational Content Repository

Welcome to a revolutionary platform for sharing and accessing open-source educational content, secured on the Stacks blockchain! This project empowers educators, learners, and institutions to contribute, verify, and access high-quality educational resources in a decentralized, transparent, and incentivized manner.

## ✨ Features

🔍 **Content Submission**: Educators and creators can submit educational content (e.g., articles, videos, tutorials) with metadata and a content hash.  
✅ **Content Verification**: Community-driven verification ensures content quality and authenticity.  
📖 **Content Access**: Learners can access verified content freely, with immutable proof of origin.  
💰 **Reward System**: Contributors are rewarded with tokens for high-quality submissions and verifications.  
🗳 **Governance**: Community voting for platform rules and content moderation policies.  
📊 **Analytics**: Track content usage and contributor impact transparently on-chain.  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Content Creators**  
- Generate a SHA-256 hash of your educational content (e.g., PDF, video, or text).  
- Submit content metadata (title, description, category, hash) via the `ContentRegistry` contract.  
- Content is queued for verification by the community.  

**For Verifiers**  
- Use the `ContentVerification` contract to review and vote on submitted content.  
- Verified content is marked as accessible; low-quality or malicious content is rejected.  

**For Learners**  
- Browse and access verified content via the `ContentAccess` contract.  
- Verify content authenticity using the stored hash and metadata.  

**For Contributors**  
- Earn tokens through the `RewardSystem` contract for submitting or verifying content.  
- Participate in governance via the `Governance` contract to vote on platform policies.  

**For Analytics**  
- Use the `Analytics` contract to view content usage stats, contributor rankings, and platform activity.  

## 📜 Smart Contracts

The project uses 6 Clarity smart contracts to manage the decentralized repository:

1. **ContentRegistry**: Handles content submission, storing metadata and hashes.  
2. **ContentVerification**: Manages community-driven content review and approval.  
3. **ContentAccess**: Provides read-only access to verified content metadata and hashes.  
4. **RewardSystem**: Distributes tokens to contributors and verifiers based on activity.  
5. **Governance**: Enables community voting on platform rules and content policies.  
6. **Analytics**: Tracks content usage, contributor stats, and platform metrics.  

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Set Up Your Environment**  
   - Install the [Stacks CLI](https://docs.stacks.co/stacks-101/installation) and a Clarity development environment.  
   - Deploy the contracts on the Stacks testnet using the provided deployment scripts.  

2. **Submit Content**  
   - Hash your educational content (e.g., using SHA-256).  
   - Call `register-content` in the `ContentRegistry` contract with the hash, title, description, and category.  

3. **Verify Content**  
   - Use the `ContentVerification` contract to review and vote on queued submissions.  
   - Approved content becomes accessible; rejected content is flagged.  

4. **Access Content**  
   - Query the `ContentAccess` contract to retrieve verified content metadata and verify authenticity.  

5. **Earn Rewards**  
   - Contributors and verifiers earn tokens via the `RewardSystem` contract for successful submissions and verifications.  

6. **Participate in Governance**  
   - Use the `Governance` contract to propose and vote on platform changes.  

7. **Track Analytics**  
   - Query the `Analytics` contract for insights on content popularity and contributor activity.  

## 🧑‍💻 Example Workflow

**Creator**:  
- Uploads a math tutorial PDF, generates its hash, and submits it with the title "Algebra Basics" and category "Mathematics" to `ContentRegistry`.  
- Content is queued for verification.  

**Verifier**:  
- Reviews the submission, confirms it meets quality standards, and votes to approve via `ContentVerification`.  

**Learner**:  
- Accesses the verified tutorial metadata via `ContentAccess`, confirms authenticity using the hash, and downloads the content from IPFS or another decentralized storage.  

**Contributor**:  
- Creator and verifier receive tokens from `RewardSystem` for their contributions.  

**Community**:  
- Votes on a proposal to update verification criteria using the `Governance` contract.  

**Analyst**:  
- Queries `Analytics` to see that "Algebra Basics" has 1,000 views and is trending in the Mathematics category.  

## 🔒 Why Stacks & Clarity?

- **Stacks Blockchain**: Leverages Bitcoin’s security for immutable content records.  
- **Clarity**: Provides predictable, secure smart contracts with transparent execution.  
- **Decentralized**: Ensures no single entity controls the repository, promoting trust and accessibility.  

## 🌟 Benefits

- **Accessibility**: Free, open-source educational content for learners worldwide.  
- **Transparency**: Immutable records of content origin and verification.  
- **Incentivization**: Rewards for contributors and verifiers to encourage participation.  
- **Community-Driven**: Governance ensures the platform evolves with user needs.  

## 📚 Future Enhancements
